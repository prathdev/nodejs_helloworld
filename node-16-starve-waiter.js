Node.js is not the best option if you have a high CPU task 
that you need to do on a client request in a multiclient 
server environment. However, if this is the case, you will 
be very hard-pressed to find a scalable software solution 
in any platform. Most high CPU tasks should take place offline 
and are generally offloaded to a database server using things 
such as materialized views, map reduce, and so on. Most web 
applications access the results of these computations over 
the network, and this is where Node.js shinesâ€”evented network I/O.
